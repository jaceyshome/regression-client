## 1.7.1 (2018-12-10)


### Bug Fixes

* correct the statement of showing the report ([18b493c](https://github.com/jaceyshome/regression-client/commit/18b493c))
* disable report link if the report is null ([5a780cb](https://github.com/jaceyshome/regression-client/commit/5a780cb))
* fix the hover state doesn't update the history-details-view report link ([198ae48](https://github.com/jaceyshome/regression-client/commit/198ae48))


### Features

* add change-log ([5a22f73](https://github.com/jaceyshome/regression-client/commit/5a22f73))
* add report link to the history result ([750720f](https://github.com/jaceyshome/regression-client/commit/750720f))
* add route control for the history and test, so it is able to use route to load a test result ([25f26cb](https://github.com/jaceyshome/regression-client/commit/25f26cb))
* featch latest 20 histories ([bf58bf3](https://github.com/jaceyshome/regression-client/commit/bf58bf3))
* instead of meaning test fails, replace with test pending, which makes more sense for the end users, as some of the visual result differences for example seeing date and time changes in social feed which is correct behaviour  ([bfe3371](https://github.com/jaceyshome/regression-client/commit/bfe3371))
* make the history list align right, so all buttons are on one site. ([58e96f3](https://github.com/jaceyshome/regression-client/commit/58e96f3))

* set application init state ([80ffb12](https://github.com/jaceyshome/regression-client/commit/80ffb12))

* update fonts with Roboto ([118c955](https://github.com/jaceyshome/regression-client/commit/118c955))
